# Marketing flywheels

## User-generated content

Empower members to create content that other members learn from and new
users are attracted by. This content has multiple downstream impacts: increasing activation and overall success, driving traffic and signups, and encouraging other members to create their own content.

### Example flywheel motion

1. Community member Peggy writes an article on a new feature
2. The article is shared in the organization's newsletter and Discord
3. Community member Neil sees the article and learns about the new feature
4. Neil appreciates the value he gets from the article and wants to write about another feature
5. Neil shares his article in the community and talks to the community team to be featured in the newsletter
6. Neil's article is featured in the newsletter and community member Walter gains value from the article going back to step 3

### Metrics to watch

- Member-created articles, videos
- Member-shared content

## Word-of-mouth distribution

Leveraging the community is an effective way to get important messages out.
Members are more likely to listen to each other than marketing material, which they might ignore or not see.

### Example flywheel motion

1. A new feature is released
2. An email is sent to all Orbit 1 members with details and easy promotional materials (social templates, etc) and a call to action to share
3. Orbit level 1 member Peggy shares on Twitter
4. Many Orbit level 2/3 members follow Peggy and see the post
5. They read the post and share (level 2s convert to level 1s)
6. The next feature release, the level 1 list has grown and begins again.

This approach has advantages over a pure marketing approach. If there are
problems with the announcement, the feedback from Orbit 1 members will catch it.

Orbit 2 and 3 members are more likely to receive and pay attention to the
announcement, since it's coming from Orbit 1 members that they trust and look up to.
