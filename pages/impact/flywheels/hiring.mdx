# The Hiring flywheel

Hiring is a challenge for all companies, costing lots of time and money. A
community-based hiring flywheel can help by producing quality candidates who are
already familiar with the company and its product.

This flywheel often starts when a user falls in love with a product, begins
advocating for it in the community, and then joins the company to work on the
product full-time.

## Example flywheel motion

1. Sally is introduced to the product by Neil
1. Sally falls in love with the product
1. Sally starts helping other people use it
1. Company notices and assigns Sally the community role of `Ambassador`
1. Sally does so well that the company hires Sally full time ðŸŽ‰
1. In her new role, Sally introduces the product to Buzz
1. Back to step 2 with Buzz...

The great thing about flywheels is that outputs from later steps feed back into
earlier ones. As Sally discovers more future advocates, some will enter the
flywheel as Buzz has done. Once they reach later stages, they'll find future
advocates too.

#### Metrics to watch

* Member questions answered
* Member content created
* Candidates referred by community
* Referred candidates hired

The outcome of this funnel can measured by the number of candidates applied,
given offers, and hired. Looking at all these metrics together will help make
sure that not only is the flywheel product candidates, but that some of these
are a good fit for the company.
