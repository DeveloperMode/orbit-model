# Clout: external reach

Members have reach within the community due to their relationships with
other members. But what about outside the community? Members who
are well-connected and influential outside the community can bring widespread
awareness and credibility to the community's mission, and help attract new
members. We call this kind of reach _clout_.

### Why clout?

We use the word clout because it's short and easier to say than _external
reach_. There's one more reason. Once upon a time, there was a startup called
[Klout](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klout). They weren't excellent spellers,
but they were good at one thing: quantifying an individual's general reputation
and influence on the internet. They took into account signals from Twitter,
LinkedIn, and yes that's right, Google+. Klout are known as the pioneers of
clout computing (citation needed).

## Measuring clout

There's no single way to measure clout, but here are a few signals that can be
useful.

- Social media followers on Twitter, LinkedIn, Instagram, etc.
- Portfolio presence on GitHub, Dribble, Flickr, Unsplash, etc.
- Reputation on StackOverflow, Quora, Reddit, HackerNews, or forums
- Leadership roles in other communities
- Job title and company size or reputation
- Pays for trips to space

There are many possibilities. We recommend paying attention to the 1 or 2 that
are the most relevant for your community. If your community is an industry trade
association, it's important to pay attention to the job title and company of
your members. Whether they post dank memes on Twitter may be amusing but less relevant.

## Clout in action

How can understanding a member's clout help you build your community?
Here's a few ideas.

### Attracting members to new communities

A new community generally needs to grow, and attracting some high clout members
can help attract others. Of course, it's very important that they be the right
member, and they'll attract others who are likely to add to the community's gravity
and not weaken it.

### High-visibility opportunities

High clout members make good headliners and keynote speakers. They can help draw a
large crowd that will generate excitement for both current and future members.

### Amplifying messages

Members with high clout thanks to a large social media following can help you
get the word out publicly about community events, programs, and milestones.
