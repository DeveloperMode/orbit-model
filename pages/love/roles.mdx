# Roles

Roles group members according to the jobs they do in the community, or that we
need them to do. Roles can be acquired by doing certain activities or assigned
by community leaders. Roles are a good way to increase love, as they provide
clear paths up the commitment curve and often come with expectations around the
frequency of participation. Plus, people just like to know what they are
supposed to do and how often.

Roles are not required to use the Orbit Model. In smaller communities, roles and
orbit levels may be the same thing. In more complex communities, there may be
many roles, and levels may make sense to use within each role, not globally. Use
roles to the extent it helps you make sense of what groups of members are doing
or need to do to help the community achieve its goals.

## Example: open source project

The mission of an open source project may be to make high-quality software
freely available to a large number of people. Given that mission, we can infer
that we'll need `Core Team Members` and `Maintainers` to build and guide the
project, `Developer Advocates` and `Documentarians` to help it be understood and
adopted, and finally the end `Users` to use it, report bugs, and suggest
enhancements. Some end `Users` may also become `Code Contributors` if they
submit changes themselves.

| Roles in an open source community |                  |
| --------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| Maintainer                        | User             |
| Core Team Member                  | Code Contributor |
| Developer Advocate                | Documentarian    |
| Financial Backer                  | Project Manager  |

Roles in this community are not mutually exclusive. A member may be a Maintainer, a
User, and a Documentarian at the same time.

## Assigning roles

Once a community's roles have been defined, the next step is to determine how to
assign roles to each member.

### Appointed roles

Some roles are like titles and should be explicitly bestowed by leadership.
That's usually for a small portion of the membership. Appointed roles in an open
source community may include `Core Team Member` or `Project Manager`.

### Acquired roles

Members acquire roles by doing a certain amount or type of activity. In
our open source example, the `User` role could be given to anyone who clones or
downloads the project. The `Developer Advocate` role could be given to any
member who has written a blog post or given a talk. It's up to each community to
make their own roles and rules.

Here's a larger set of acquired roles for our open source community:

| Roles              | Activity Types                               |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| Core Team Member   | Merge Code, Organize Meetings, Give Keynotes |
| Maintainer         | Merge Code, Attend Meetings                  |
| Developer Advocate | Give Talks, Write Blog Posts, Fix Issues     |
| Code Contributor   | Submit Pull Requests                         |
| Documentation      | Write Documentation                          |
| User               | Sign up, Download, Open Issues               |
| Financial Backer   | Donate Money                                 |

## How roles increase love

Defining clear roles in the community is a good way to increase love and the
community's overall impact. Members like to know what they should do and how
often they should do it.

The following table outlines a set of expectations for different roles in
our example open source community.

| Role (Who)         | Activity Type (What) | Frequency |
| ------------------ | -------------------- | --------- |
| Maintainer         | Attend Meetings      | Monthly   |
| Code Contributor   | Submit Pull Requests | Weekly    |
| Developer Advocate | Write Blog Posts     | Monthly   |
| Financial Backer   | Donate Money         | Monthly   |
| User               | Attend Conference    | Yearly    |
| User               | Open Issues          | As needed |

### Roles and orbit levels

In complex communities with many roles and subcommunities, it's possible to
combine roles and orbit levels. Each role, like `Code Contributor` or `Financial Backer` can have its own love and orbit levels, each capturing a level of
commitment that is unique to the member's contributions in a specific area, e.g.
code or monetary donations.
