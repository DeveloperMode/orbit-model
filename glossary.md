# Orbit Model Glossary
 
###  3Rs
Right person, Right opportunity, Right time
* Right Person - Who?
* Right Opportunity - What?
* Right Time - When?
* Great 3R moments lead to great Outcomes
  
###  Alerts
Generate notifications when criteria are met
* Notify me if someone has been Promoted
* Notify me if an Opportunity should be offered
  
### Channels 
The places that Orbiters and Guides interact. 
 
###  Connections
Relationships between Orbiters, other Orbiters, and Guides

### Exchanges
An interaction between Orbiters
  * subset of Moments  

### Gravity
Every Orbiter has a score based on Love and Reach

### Guides 
The people guiding the Orbiters (community managers)

### Incentives
Rewards offered in return for opportunities, tangible or intangible

### Levels
Orbiters are segmented by Gravity
  * Different Opportunities are given to Orbiters based on Level

### Love 
Level of commitment of each Orbiter to the product or community
  * Depth (Education + Experience) and Happiness components
  * More Love = More receptiveness to Opportunities
  * NPS is a way to measure Love (or at least Happiness)
  * Measured in Hearts

### Moments
An interaction between an Orbiter and something in the Solar System 

### Opportunities
Activities that Orbiters can do
  * Completed Opportunities can increase Love and/or Reach
  
### Orbit 00
Community / DevRel Team, a.k.a. the Core

### Orbit 0
Company, a.k.a. the Sun

### Orbit 1
Ambassadors

### Orbit 2
Fans

### Orbit 3
Users

### Orbit 4
Observers

### Orbiters
The people in Orbit

### Outcomes
The result of an Opportunity being completed
  * Outcomes should increase Gravity of those involved

### Promotions
Orbiters move to higher orbit levels as their gravity increases
### Reach - Influence of each Orbiter is known
  * Measured in Moments generated
      * i.e. 2k likes on twitter could be 2k moments
      * 10k moments for a personal blog with 10k page views
  * Function of social media / forums / online presence
  * Function of company size (specifically number of engineers)

### Solar System
A container for everything in Orbit

### Triggers
Generate Opportunities when some criteria are met

## What does *Right* mean?
### Right opportunity
The most impactful opportunity that could be offered. 

### Right person
The ask matches the person's gravity + level. 

### Right time
The ask is timely (e.g. an event invitation is sent at the right time). 

The more 3R moments that Orbit can surface (and take action on), the more powerful a tool it will be for building the community.
