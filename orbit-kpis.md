# Orbit Model KPIs
A team using the Orbit Model measures:

- Total number of Orbiters
    - 1,500 Orbiters
- Size of each Orbit Level
    - O1 = 50 Orbiters, O2 = 200, O3 = 800, O3 = 6000
- Growth of each Orbit Level
    - From Promotions
    - From New Orbiters
    - Open question - how do we differentiate?
- Rate of Promotion between Levels
    - Last month, 18% of O2 were Promoted to O1
- Rate of Churn (Demotion) between Levels
    - Last month, 3% of O2 fell to O3
- Number of Opportunities offered and completed
    - Last month the Guides gave out 806 Opportunities, 210 of which were completed
- Total Love, Reach, and Gravity in the Solar System
    - Total Love:
        - For each Orbiter
            - Survey for Happiness (NPS)
            - Use Data or Survey for Depth (Education and Experience)
        - Track Total Love and Average Love over time
            - Segment by Orbit Level
    - Total Reach:
        - For each Orbiter
            - How many Moments do they generate
        - Track Total Love and Average Reach over time
            - Segment by Orbit Level
    - Total Gravity:
        - Multiply Total Love and Total Reach per member
            - Segment by Orbit Level
        - Add it all up
