# Welcome to the Orbit Model

The Orbit Model is a framework for building high-gravity communities. A high-gravity community is one that excels at attracting and retaining members by offering an outstanding member experience.

The Orbit Model was designed for communities of software developers but the principles apply to most things that are community-shaped. The model was first used in 2014 and put on GitHub in November 2019 so anyone can use it and contribute back. We aim to make these tools useful to open source maintainers, developer advocates, community managers, and anyone interested in building a community.

# Introduction

The Orbit Model is a vocabulary and visual canvas that makes it easier to ask, discuss, and answer questions about your community. Questions like:

- What should each community member be doing?
- What do I call a highly-engaged community member?
- How do I prioritize who to spend time with?
- How do I attract new people to the community?
- How do I measure my community's engagement? Growth?

Who can use the Orbit Model?

- Community-driven businesses
- Non-profit organizations
- Developer communities
- Open source projects
- Casual communities
- and more...

### The solar system

The underlying metaphor is one we all learned about in school: the solar system. A solar system, with all of its celestial bodies and concentric orbits, lends itself well to visualizing a community. Some members are close to the heart of things, others far way. Some members are as large and visible as Jupiter, others barely the size an asteriod. And of course, everything is constantly in motion.

To make it easy to discuss the differences between members, the Orbit Model assigns each person 2 core attributes: _love_ and _reach_. Advocates and community managers actively try to increase these for their members.

## Love

Love is a member's level of engagement and investment in the community. Someone with high love is highly active, capable, and experienced. They're willing and able to play key roles in the community like contributing, moderating, and organizing.

> "Jennifer has come to the last 5 meetups and next month she's hosting her own. In addition, she just published a blog post about how to install our package on Linux. Her love is increasing fast this year!"

People have different degrees of love for each of the communities that they participate in, so love is measured on a community-by-community basis. I might have high love for the running club I help organize but relatively low love for my neighborhood association where I usually skip the meetings.

### Measuring love

To calculate love, we start by counting all the activities that a member has done within a recent time period. For example:

- Attended our conference
- Spoke at a meetup
- Opened a pull request on GitHub
- Answered a question on our forum

It's important to be tracking when members do these activities so you can do the math. Each activity is given a score of how much engagement it represents. In the Orbit Model, we like to keep the numbers easy to calculate and uniform across model users, so we recommend using a simple 1-10 scale.

> "Organizing a community meetup takes a lot of time and effort, so we give it an activity score of 8/10. Just attending a meetup is a 3/10, but publishing a summary counts for 2 more points."

Once we have a member's activity history, we look at both the _maximum_ and _sum_ of the activity scores. The maximum tells us the largest contribution the member has made and the sum gives us a picture of their overall impact. Both are important inputs into the decision of the member's orbit level, but it's the **maximum** that we generally use as the single figure when talking about a member's love, since it tells us more about the highest future contributions the member could make. We'll see why that's important later when we discuss opportunities.

> "Jennifer's biggest contribution this year was organizing that meetup, an 8/10 for us. So in our database, her love is 8.

Defining your community's list of activities and activity scores is one of the first things to do when starting with the Orbit Model.

## Reach

If love is a measure of engagement within the community, reach is a measure of broader influence. Reach takes into account a member's reputation and sphere of influence, however that falls inside and outside the community.

> "Matthew is one of our highest-reach community members. He's constantly engaging with folks on twitter and runs a blog with thousands of visitors per month. He's also a senior engineer at a well-respected agency."

Unlike love, the Orbit Model tends to see a person's reach as independent of a particular community. Exceptions do apply for established communities where understanding a member's reach solely inside of that community is useful, but for smaller communities looking to grow it's generally more important to know about a member's reach in the broad sense.

Why do we care about reach? Because individuals with high reach will attract others to join them as they journey through our solar system. Our relationship and love-building investment in high-reach individuals may pay off bigger as a result. Everyone has some reach though, and one of our jobs as an orbit modeler is to help each of our members grow their reach.

### Measuring reach

To calculate reach, we need to look at evidence of a member's sphere of influence and reputation. There's no silver bullet and the most important metric to look at will depend on your goals, but here are a few common examples:

- Social media signals like followers and engagement
- Followers and star counts of open source projects on GitHub
- Reputation scores on communities like StackOverflow
- Title and position inside their company
- Pagerank or estimated traffic to their website or blog

Like with love, we can create a simple 1-10 scale of reach and then determine how to assign each member a score.

> "Matthew has over 1,000 followers on Twitter: that counts for 2 points. He also has an active blog: there's another 2. Finally, he has an open source project with more than 500 stars on GitHub. Since our community has many developers, we count 4 points for that, bringing his total to 8/10."

Assigning the scales and scores might feel arbitrary, and that's okay. The absolute values don't matter. What matters is that the scale gives you a decent picture of one member relative to another, and becomes useful to you in describing and prioritizing work. Don't be afraid to try different combinations of values to see what feels right.

## Gravity

When a community has a big pull due to the love and reach of its members, we say it has high gravity. That pull acts to retain existing members and attract new ones. Potential members see the work going into the community, the value it creates for its members, and eventually get curious about whether they should get involved.

> The startup community in France has picked up a lot of gravity since 2010. Not only are there more companies and enterpreneurs today, but well-known succes stories have made it easier for companies to attract global talent.

Gravity is a function of both love—in this example the work that people have put into building the French ecosystem—and also reach—the visibilty and awareness of French companies in the global market. **The combination of love & reach is the magic recipe that leads to higher growth and sustainability than either factor can alone**. Just like a great product can still struggle to produce sales without some kind of marketing, a high-love community can struggle to maintain its gravity if it can't develop enough reach.

### Measuring gravity

Love and reach are measured at the individual level, but gravity is measured at the group or community level. Gravity can also be measured for each orbit level.

Gravity should reflect things that are happening in the community:

- Gravity goes up when new members join
- Gravity goes up when members participate more (increased love)
- Gravity goes up when members make the community visible (increased reach)
- Gravity goes down when we lose members or participation declines

A basic equation that takes those factors into account is:

```
Gravity = Sum(Love * Reach) for each member
```

The simplest way to calculate gravity is just to sum up the product of love and reach for each member.

In pseudocode that looks like:

```
gravity = 0
for each member
  gravity += (member.love * member.reach)
```

Reach is multiplied by (not added to) love because an increase in a member's reach has the potential to make their impact higher across each place they participate.

In practice, it's useful to introduce coefficients for love and reach that refine the calculation according to each community's need. Growth-fueled communities may assign a higher coefficient to reach, where established communities that value participation may assign a bigger number to love.

Gravity is something you can calculate on a monthly or even weekly basis to see how your community is trending. It's a good north star and barometer to track over time, and watch how the different community programs that you run affect it.

# Orbit levels

In most communities, there are a few members with a lot of love, a lot of members with a little love, and other groups of people somewhere in between. In the Orbit Model, we call these cohorts _orbit levels_. The highest-love members orbit at the level closest to the center of the solar system.

Orbit levels are a practical tool for segmenting the community and designing different programs at each level, along with clear pathways for members to move between them. Orbit levels also provide a handy vocabulary for talking about the role each member plays in the community.

You can name your orbit levels whatever fits your community the best, but the model comes with some standard names that tend to work for most communities. Each orbit level has a corresponding number, with 1 reserved for the most highly engaged folks. Numbers increase from there as engagement decreases.

## Orbit 4 - Observers

Orbit 4 is called Observers. These are folks who’ve read our community's blog posts, watched talks, followed us on twitter, or tried our product. They're not fully-activated community members yet, but are at least passively interested and form a part of our audience. They might not join your community today but might in the future, and finding ways to stay top of mind with them is important.

Content is a great way to engage with observers, as well as lighweight events where they can learn without feeling any pressure.

## Orbit 3 - Users

Orbit 3 is called Users. These individuals have navigated the onramp into the community and are starting to establish a track record of usage (if there's a product involved) or participation. They've made some lightweight contributions like writing documentation, doing translation, or volunteering at an event.

Online community channels like forums are a good way to engage with users, as it gives them a chance to learn the norms and personalities of the community while taking small steps to contribute. Likewise, events where they can meet other members are good.

## Orbit 2 - Fans

Orbit 2 is called Fans. These folks have graduated from being just Users by taking on more time-intensive, higher impact roles in the community. They might be moderating the forum, guiding the chat room, giving talks, or hosting small events. They're consistent, recognizable faces who embody the culture and actions the community expects.

Motivating and engaging with fans is more high-touch than users or observers. They'll appreciate hands-on activities like workshops and that match them with community leaders that they can learn from.

## Orbit 1 - Ambassadors

Orbit 1 is reserved for the inner circle, the Ambassadors. These individuals have very high love for the community, taking on important challenges and playing a leadership role. They're known to many other members, who look to them for guidance and help. They may head one or more large groups inside of the community.

The relationship with ambassadors is close, personal, and transparent. Ambassadors appreciate getting early access to products and events, plus special opportunities that help them reach their individual goals.

## "Orbit 0"

The folks that have the ultimate responsibility for the community occupy the center of the solar system, at Orbit 0. In a product or technology community, these are the people and organizations who own the asset that the community is building around. In an open source community, this is the core team. In a casual community, these are the organizers.

Folks in Orbit 0 have the dual responsibility to engage both inside the community and advocate for it outside to all of its various stakeholders.

## Mapping members to levels

Love and reach are values that you measure, but orbit level is a choice that you make for each member based on where you believe they can best serve (and will be best served by) the community.

> Jamie is creating content and coming to each of our meetups, plus she's volunteered to speak next month. Her activity and responsibility level is consistent with our Fans, so let's put her into Orbit 2.

Generally speaking, the higher the love—measured as the maximum contribution they've made or the volume of contribution—should closely correlate with the orbit level. High-love members should go into orbits 1 and 2, with lower love members being further out at 3 and 4.

## Community activation

Between O3 and O2 is the asteroid belt. Here you must cross the chasm from user to fan. This is where community activation happens, building on product activation from O4 to O3. It takes something personal to really make a fan, as a well-thought-out box of swag or a kind email recognizing something cool the developer has built. Getting some facetime on a call or at a meetup works well too. In other words, you have to win the heart as well as the mind.

A DevRel team should have a variety of programs in place to help developers across the chasm from the product into the community, becoming bigger fans and advocates in the process.

## Groups

Big communities are generally composed of sets of smaller communities. In the context of the whole system, these smaller communities are simply called _groups_. The nucleus of a group can be a person, place, or thing.

- Person example: An influential community member; an ambassador
- Place example: A geographic location like a city, state, or country; an employer; a program
- Thing example: A subproject; a unique belief or perspective; a skill or experience

A community member needs less reach to attract someone in their group compared to the broader community. Members who associate with a specific person, place, or thing have a lower barrier to becoming collaborators. The fruits of their collaborations will draw in more contributors from their group and eventually, the whole community.

In the Orbit Model, groups can be visualized as pie slices stretching from O1 out to O4. Each group has its own ambassadors, fans, users, and observers.

When pie slices overlap, it means that some members are part of both groups. As an example, imagine two groups: "PHP developers" and "Developers in London". Some of the PHP developer groups might also be in our London group. The more groups that members share, the more likely it is that their reach will bring themselves in contact with each other.

To increase overall community gravity faster, identify active or potential groups, and connect members around those shared nuclei. As the groups start to take shape, make connections between them.

## Orbit vs. funnel

Many orbit model users ask about its relationship to the traditional marketing funnel. The funnel is a model for _capturing value_ for the company. The key measurements are conversion through the different stages and ultimately the revenue from conversion.

Orbit is a model for _creating value_ for the community and thereby increasing its gravity. We measure how much value is being created in the community and who is doing it, in order to offer the people the right rewards and opportunities.

Here's a quick table summing up a few key differences:

| Funnel                           | Orbit                         |
| -------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Conversion                       | Adoption                      |
| Value capture                    | Value creation                |
| Push people through              | Pull people in                |
| Based on single purchase event   | Inclusive of entire lifecycle |
| Binary (leads vs. everyone else) | Non-binary (Orbit Levels)     |

The funnel is a _push_ model. Marketers put together campaigns that actively deliver messages to customer inboxes and messaging apps to try and make them take action on something, to push them to the next stage of the funnel.

Orbit is a _pull_ model. Rather than fill up inboxes with unsolicited communications, the community manager using orbit strives to make their community as entiticing as possible, such that existing members will spread it via word-of-mouth and new members will naturally pull themselves in once they see the value others are getting.

This theme is prevalent across all of modern marketing. The customer is in the driver's seat with unlimited access to information and also the reviews of other people. Educating and informing the customer is more effective than trying to mislead or trick them with untestable claims and the same empty hype as everyone else.

### Using orbit + funnel together 🍦

When a company adopts orbit, does it replace the funnel? No, not usually. Marketing and sales teams continue to use the funnel to drive purchases and revenue. Community, developer relations, and some marketing sub-teams (e.g. brand advocacy or influencer marketing) use the orbit to drive engagement and community growth. Think of it like an ice cream cone, with a big scoop perched on a waffle cone. Inevitably, some of the ice cream melts and trickles down the cone.

The orbit and funnel meet when a community member reaches the decision that they'd like to purchase or evaluate a product. For complex products, like technology platforms, it's a best practice for the developer advocate or community manager to make an introduction between the potential buyer and someone on the sales team. This ensures a warm handoff and ensures that the sales team has the full context of the buyer's situation, making the sales process move along more smoothly.

"Handoff" makes it sound easy, but it's actually very important work that is essential for community teams to get credit for, since it contributes to revenue and helps build the community business case. The term "DevRel qualified lead" from DevRel & community leader [Mary Thengvall](https://twitter.com/mary_grace) is an important one to have in your vocabulary for this reason.
