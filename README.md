# Welcome to the Orbit Model

The Orbit Model helps developer advocates, evangelists, and community managers build communities that excel at attracting and retaining members. It's meant to be added to and improved by all of us.

## The Orbit Model replaces conversion with connection.

As the marketing funnel is to conversion, the orbit is to community-led adoption. The orbit model is incrementally adaptable, meaning that you can start using it today for just parts of your community, not the whole thing. We recommend you begin with [Orbit 1](#orbit-1---ambassadors). Identify your developers with the highest gravity and make a plan for extending their love and reach even further.

# Key Concepts of the Orbit Model

üìö [Read the glossary](glossary.md) to learn more about specific terms used in the model. 

## Orbit versus Funnel

| Funnel | Orbit |
|-----------|-----------|
| Conversion | Adoption |
| Value capture | Value creation |
| Push people through | Pull people in | 
| Based on single purchase event | Inclusive of entire lifecycle | 
| Binary (leads vs. everyone else) | Non-binary (Orbit Levels) | 


## Gravity = Love x Reach

This is the fundamental equation of the Orbit Model. Think of it this way: everyone in your community has some amount of gravity. Some ability to attract others. The gravity that each person has is a product of two things: **love and reach**.

| Love | Reach |
|-----------|-----------|
| Love is their love for what you do. That includes expert knowledge in your technology, a high degree of satisfaction, and feeling like part of the tribe. | Reach is a measure of how well they can help spread the love. Developers with a lot of reach tend to be well-connected, respected by their peers, and have a passion for teaching and sharing. |


## Orbit Levels

Love, reach, and gravity are important because they help you segment your community into different levels. We call these orbit levels. Having orbit levels enables you to give the right opportunity to the right person at the right time.

You can name your orbit levels what you want and have as many as you like, but to have a standard we can all reference, we describe 4 levels with the following names that reflect the shape of many modern communities.

### Orbit 1 - Ambassadors

Orbit 1 is reserved for our inner circle, our Ambassadors. Others call these folks Champions or VIPs or MVPs. The way that we engage with members in each orbit level is different. For ambassadors, who we should know by name, we communicate with via 1:1 email, slack DM, or even texts or Whatsapp. We don‚Äôt need many of them, but each ambassador counts because they have a lot of love and reach.

### Orbit 2 - Fans

Orbit 2 is our fans. These folks are passionate about the technology, can easily explain what it does and how to use it, and are connected to some kind of work or local community. They might not have the love or reach of the ambassadors, but with your help, they might someday. In the orbit model, we call it a promotion when a member jumps up a level.

### Orbit 3 - Users

Orbit 3 is our users. These are folks who have some kind of working integration, some kind of sustained activity. Most customers fall into this level, and there can be thousands of them. To help us drive adoption for our community, we need to find the ones we can promote to fans and learn how to motivate them.


### Orbit 4 - Observers

Orbit 4 is our Observers. These are folks who‚Äôve read our blog posts, watched our talks, kicked the tires with one of our sample apps, or just followed us on twitter. Relative to the other levels, there are a lot of observers. But at some point in the future, many of these observers might need our technology for something, so we must stay top of mind with them.

## Total Gravity

Orbit is a model for increasing the gravity of individual members and the total gravity of the whole community. Over time, if a community doesn‚Äôt maintain enough total gravity, it‚Äôs likely to see its members pulled away to other places.

# Other Concepts

## Conversion vs. Adoption

- The funnel, and conversion, is a *push* model
    - You push people through the funnel
- The orbit and adoption is a *pull* model
    - You make it enticing enough where people want to pull themselves into orbit
- This theme is prevalent across modern marketing
    - consumers are  in the driver‚Äôs seat
    - they have access to all the information to make their choices, including the competitor

## Value capture vs. Value creation

- The funnel is a model for *capturing value* for the company
    - What you measure is conversion and the revenue from conversion
- The orbit is a model for *creating value* for the community
    - What you measure is how much value you‚Äôve created for the community - how much you‚Äôve educated them, helped them, given them more reach, etc.

## ‚òÑÔ∏è Community activation

Between O3 and O2 is the asteroid belt. Here you must cross the chasm from user to fan. This is where community activation happens, building on product activation from O4 to O3. It takes something personal to really make a fan, as a well-thought-out box of swag or a kind email recognizing something cool the developer has built. Getting some facetime on a call or at a meetup works well too. In other words, you have to win the heart as well as the mind.

A DevRel team should have a variety of programs in place to help developers across the chasm from the product into the community, becoming bigger fans and advocates in the process.

## Groups

Big communities emerge from sets of smaller communities. In the context of the whole system, these smaller communities are simply called _groups_. The nucleus of a group can be a person, place, or thing.

- Person example: An influential community member; an ambassador
- Place example: A geographic location like a city, state, or country; an employer; a program
- Thing example: A subproject; a unique belief or perspective; a skill or experience

A community member needs less reach to attract someone in their group compared to the broader community. Members who associate with a specific person, place, or thing have a lower barrier to becoming collaborators. The fruits of their collaborations will draw in more contributors from their group and eventually, the whole community.

In the Orbit Model, groups can be visualized as pie slices stretching from O1 out to O4. Each group has its own ambassadors, fans, users, and observers.

When pie slices overlap, it means that some members are part of both groups. As an example, imagine two groups: "PHP developers" and "Developers in London". Some of the PHP developer groups might also be in our London group. The more groups that members share, the more likely it is that their reach will bring themselves in contact with each other.

To increase overall community gravity faster, identify active or potential groups, and connect members around those shared nuclei. As the groups start to take shape, make connections between them.

## 1:few:many

Marketing is a 1:many model. Sales is a 1:1 or 1:few model. Community isn't either of these.

Community is **1:few:many**. You, as the dev advocate or community manager, are the 1. You have a deep relationship with handful ambassadors - they are the few. Those ambassadors have deep relationships with the people in their communities - they are the many.

The 1:few:many model explains why so many things that don't scale in a community (like facetime and relationship-building) still can have tremendous results. It's the ripple effect.

## Using orbit + funnel together üç¶

When a company adopts orbit, does it replace the funnel? No, not usually. Marketing and sales teams continue to use the funnel to drive purchases and revenue. Community, developer relations, and some marketing sub-teams (e.g. brand advocacy or influencer marketing) use the orbit to drive engagement and community growth. Think of it like an ice cream cone, with a big scoop perched on a waffle cone. Inevitably, some of the ice cream melts and trickles down the cone.

The orbit and funnel meet when a community member reaches the decision that they'd like to purchase or evaluate a product. For complex products, like technology platforms, it's a best practice for the developer advocate or community manager to make an introduction between the potential buyer and someone on the sales team. This ensures a warm handoff and ensures that the sales team has the full context of the buyer's situation, making the sales process move along more smoothly. 

"Handoff" makes it sound easy, but it's actually very important work that is essential for community teams to get credit for, since it contributes to revenue and helps build the community business case. The term "DevRel qualified lead" from DevRel & community leader [Mary Thengvall](https://twitter.com/mary_grace) is an important one to have in your vocabulary for this reason. Check out [Mary's talk from DevRelCon London 2019](https://devrel.net/strategy-and-metrics/dont-create-re-use) to learn more about what it is and how to apply it.
