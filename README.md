# üõ∞Ô∏è Orbit Model

The Orbit Model helps developer advocates, evangelists, and community managers build enthusiastic communities. It's meant to be added to and improved by all of us.

As the funnel is to conversion, the orbit is to adoption. The orbit model is incrementally adoptable, meaning that you can start using it today for just parts of your community, not the whole thing. We recommend you start with Orbit 1. Identify your developers with the highest gravity and make a plan for extending their love and reach even further.

## Gravity = Love x Reach

This is the fundamental equation of the Orbit Model. Think of it this way: everyone in your community has some amount of gravity. Some ability to attract others. The gravity that each person has is a product of two things: love and reach.

### Love

Love is their love for what you do. That includes expert knowledge in your technology, a high degree of satisfaction, and feeling like part of the tribe.

### Reach

Reach is a measure of how well they can help spread the love. Developers with a lot of reach tend to be well-connected, respected by their peers, and have a passion for teaching and sharing.

## Orbit Levels

Love, reach, and gravity are important because they help you segment your community into different levels. We call these orbit levels. Having orbit levels helps you give the right opportunity to the right person at the right time.

### Orbit 1 - Ambassadors

Orbit 1 is reserved for our inner circle, our Ambassadors. Others call these folks Champions or VIPs or MVPs. The way that we engage with members in each orbit level is different. For ambassadors, who we should know by name, we communicate with via 1:1 email, slack DM, or even texts or Whatsapp. We don‚Äôt need many of them, but each ambassador counts because they have a lot of love and reach.

### Orbit 2 - Fans

Orbit 2 is our fans. These folks are passionate about the technology, can easily explain what it does and how to use it, and are connected to some kind of work or local community. They might not have the love or reach of the ambassadors, but with your help they might someday. In the orbit model, we call it a promotion when a member jumps up a level.

### Orbit 3 - Users

Orbit 3 is our users. These are folks who have some kind of working integration, some kind of sustained activity. Most customers fall into this level and there can be thousands of them. To help us drive adoption for our community, we need to find the ones we can promote to fans and learn how to motivate them.


### Orbit 4 - Observers

Orbit 3 is our Observers. These are folks who‚Äôve read our blog posts, watched our talks, kicked the tires with one of our sample apps, or just followed us on twitter. Relative to the other levels, there are a lot of observers. But at some point in the future, many of these observers might need our technology for something, so it‚Äôs important we stay top of mind with them.
