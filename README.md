# Welcome to the Orbit Model

The Orbit Model is a framework for building high-gravity communities. A high-gravity community is one that excels at attracting and retaining members by increasing their love and reach.

The Orbit Model was designed for communities of software developers but the principles apply to most things that are community-shaped. The model was first used in 2014 and put on GitHub in November 2019 so anyone can use it and contribute back. We aim to make these tools useful to open source maintainers, developer advocates, community managers, and anyone interested in building a community.

# Introduction

## Love

> _Love is their love for what you do. That includes expert knowledge in your technology, a high degree of satisfaction, and feeling like part of the tribe._

## Reach

> _Reach is a measure of how well they can help spread the love. Developers with a lot of reach tend to be well-connected, respected by their peers, and have a passion for teaching and sharing._

## Gravity

# Orbit Levels

> Orbit level is a choice.

Love, reach, and gravity are important because they help you segment your community into different levels. We call these orbit levels. Having orbit levels enables you to give the right opportunity to the right person at the right time.

You can name your orbit levels what you want and have as many as you like, but to have a standard we can all reference, we describe 4 levels with the following names that reflect the shape of many modern communities.

## Orbit 4 - Observers

Orbit 4 is our Observers. These are folks who‚Äôve read our blog posts, watched our talks, kicked the tires with one of our sample apps, or just followed us on twitter. Relative to the other levels, there are a lot of observers. But at some point in the future, many of these observers might need our technology for something, so we must stay top of mind with them.

## Orbit 3 - Users

Orbit 3 is our users. These are folks who have some kind of working integration, some kind of sustained activity. Most customers fall into this level, and there can be thousands of them. To help us drive adoption for our community, we need to find the ones we can promote to fans and learn how to motivate them.

## 2 - Fans

Orbit 2 is our fans. These folks are passionate about the technology, can easily explain what it does and how to use it, and are connected to some kind of work or local community. They might not have the love or reach of the ambassadors, but with your help, they might someday. In the orbit model, we call it a promotion when a member jumps up a level.

## Orbit 1 - Ambassadors

Orbit 1 is reserved for our inner circle, our Ambassadors. Others call these folks Champions or VIPs or MVPs. The way that we engage with members in each orbit level is different. For ambassadors, who we should know by name, we communicate with via 1:1 email, slack DM, or even texts or Whatsapp. We don‚Äôt need many of them, but each ambassador counts because they have a lot of love and reach.

## Community activation

Between O3 and O2 is the asteroid belt. Here you must cross the chasm from user to fan. This is where community activation happens, building on product activation from O4 to O3. It takes something personal to really make a fan, as a well-thought-out box of swag or a kind email recognizing something cool the developer has built. Getting some facetime on a call or at a meetup works well too. In other words, you have to win the heart as well as the mind.

A DevRel team should have a variety of programs in place to help developers across the chasm from the product into the community, becoming bigger fans and advocates in the process.

## Groups

Big communities are generally composed of sets of smaller communities. In the context of the whole system, these smaller communities are simply called _groups_. The nucleus of a group can be a person, place, or thing.

- Person example: An influential community member; an ambassador
- Place example: A geographic location like a city, state, or country; an employer; a program
- Thing example: A subproject; a unique belief or perspective; a skill or experience

A community member needs less reach to attract someone in their group compared to the broader community. Members who associate with a specific person, place, or thing have a lower barrier to becoming collaborators. The fruits of their collaborations will draw in more contributors from their group and eventually, the whole community.

In the Orbit Model, groups can be visualized as pie slices stretching from O1 out to O4. Each group has its own ambassadors, fans, users, and observers.

When pie slices overlap, it means that some members are part of both groups. As an example, imagine two groups: "PHP developers" and "Developers in London". Some of the PHP developer groups might also be in our London group. The more groups that members share, the more likely it is that their reach will bring themselves in contact with each other.

To increase overall community gravity faster, identify active or potential groups, and connect members around those shared nuclei. As the groups start to take shape, make connections between them.

## Orbit vs. funnel

Many orbit model users ask about its relationship to the traditional marketing funnel. The funnel is a model for _capturing value_ for the company. The key measurements are conversion through the different stages and ultimately the revenue from conversion.

Orbit is a model for _creating value_ for the community and thereby increasing its gravity. We measure how much value is being created in the community and who is doing it, in order to offer the people the right rewards and opportunities.

Here's a quick table summing up a few key differences:

| Funnel                           | Orbit                         |
| -------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Conversion                       | Adoption                      |
| Value capture                    | Value creation                |
| Push people through              | Pull people in                |
| Based on single purchase event   | Inclusive of entire lifecycle |
| Binary (leads vs. everyone else) | Non-binary (Orbit Levels)     |

The funnel is a _push_ model. Marketers put together campaigns that actively deliver messages to customer inboxes and messaging apps to try and make them take action on something, to push them to the next stage of the funnel.

Orbit is a _pull_ model. Rather than fill up inboxes with unsolicited communications, the community manager using orbit strives to make their community as entiticing as possible, such that existing members will spread it via word-of-mouth and new members will naturally pull themselves in once they see the value others are getting.

This theme is prevalent across all of modern marketing. The customer is in the driver's seat with unlimited access to information and also the reviews of other people. Educating and informing the customer is more effective than trying to mislead or trick them with untestable claims and the same empty hype as everyone else.

### Using orbit + funnel together üç¶

When a company adopts orbit, does it replace the funnel? No, not usually. Marketing and sales teams continue to use the funnel to drive purchases and revenue. Community, developer relations, and some marketing sub-teams (e.g. brand advocacy or influencer marketing) use the orbit to drive engagement and community growth. Think of it like an ice cream cone, with a big scoop perched on a waffle cone. Inevitably, some of the ice cream melts and trickles down the cone.

The orbit and funnel meet when a community member reaches the decision that they'd like to purchase or evaluate a product. For complex products, like technology platforms, it's a best practice for the developer advocate or community manager to make an introduction between the potential buyer and someone on the sales team. This ensures a warm handoff and ensures that the sales team has the full context of the buyer's situation, making the sales process move along more smoothly.

"Handoff" makes it sound easy, but it's actually very important work that is essential for community teams to get credit for, since it contributes to revenue and helps build the community business case. The term "DevRel qualified lead" from DevRel & community leader [Mary Thengvall](https://twitter.com/mary_grace) is an important one to have in your vocabulary for this reason. Check out [Mary's talk from DevRelCon London 2019](https://devrel.net/strategy-and-metrics/dont-create-re-use) to learn more about what it is and how to apply it.
